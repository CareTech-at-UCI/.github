# Welcome to CareTech ⚕️


**We are an ICS Affiliated club established in 2024 that promotes and investigates the Health Technology field by empowering early disease detection with tech solutions**

**Core Values** 💙

- **Inclusivity**: Each person on the team should be open and willing to work together with each and every member. Throughout our projects, we always keep inclusivity in mind as inclusivity is extremely important in healthcare. 

- **Collaboration:** At CareTech, we value everyone's ideas and manage disagreements professionally. As long as both sides are open to listen and adapt, then we can work together to make quality work.

- **Quality:** As we hope to have our projects help people in the medical setting, we always strive to make our projects with **high quality.**
  
- **Ethics:** The projects that we make are **never** made to replace medical advice or medical professionals. Our hope is for our projects to **aid** people in early disease detection and **ease** the workload of medical professionals.
