# Hi! üëã Welcome to CareTech ‚öïÔ∏è


**We are a new club that promotes and investigates the Health Technology field by empowering early disease detection with innovative tech solutions**

**Core Values**

- **Inclusivity**: Each person on the team should be open to working with each and every member. Throughout our projects, we always keep inclusivity in mind. This value cannot be applied to every project but inclusivity is extremely important in healthcare. 

- **Collaboration:** When needed, we strive to work with our teammates. At CareTech, we value everyone's ideas and manage disagreements professionally. As long as both sides are open to listen and adapt, then we can work together to make quality work.

- **Quality:** We should always strive to make our projects with **high quality.** As we hope to have our projects help people in the medical setting, these should always be made with the goal of having it be **high quality.**

  ### Come join us at DBH 3011 from 6:00-7:00PM on Mondays for our General Meetings/Workshops!
